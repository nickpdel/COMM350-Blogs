### Nick Delaney _(He/Him/His)_

and I am a junior at Christopher Newport University. I am a Communication Studies major and double-minor in Digital Humanities and Writing.

I am from Dumfries, VA where I have a cat named Chewy.

In the future, I want to work in media production or design. As a kid, I've always loved thr thought of doing something with websites, movies, or even video games however, I think it's more realistic that I'll be working with something like podcasts. Hopefully, whatever it is, I'll get to use my writing abilities.

I am interested in Digital Humanities because I have found myself so engaged in things related to it previously! Not only do I enjoy playing video games, but I enjoy their debated relationship with the Digital Humanities. What makes a game DH? Are all games DH? _I want to know!_

Within DH, i get a lot of inspiration from projects that make historic artifacts accessible and modern, such as [“Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights”](https://archief.ntr.nl/tuinderlusten/en.html#). I find these projects to not only be educational, but accessible to people who would otherwise not know of them.

Connecting my fascinations of video games and accessibility, I am interested in making video games accessible and how that relates to DH. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of video games that have been forgotten by time that could easily be made accessible by developers. Recently, gamers have voiced their frustration for these "lost games."
