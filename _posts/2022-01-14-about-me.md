### Nick Delaney _(He/Him/His)_

and I am a junior at Christopher Newport University. I am a Communication Studies major and double-minor in Digital Humanities and Writing.

I am from Dumfries, VA where I have a cat named Chewy.

During my time in college and now, I am a second-year Resident Assistant and I currently oversee a freshman population. I work as a barista at Starbucks and love my time making coffee and meeting new people. As an extra-curricular, I am also a brother of Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity, which is a social fraternity dedicated to equality and social justice. During my time as a brother, I have served as President of the chapter and I am now serving as VP of Recruitment.

In the future, I want to work in media production or design. As a kid, I've always loved the thought of doing something with websites, movies, or even video games, however I think it's more realistic that I'll be working with something like podcasts. Hopefully, whatever it is, I'll get to use my writing abilities.

Speaking of podcasts, my love for media started when I made my own podcast in the summer after high school. My podcast was named [_Deep Talk: The Human Condition_](https://open.spotify.com/show/0rr9jR9qK1lwl8f732nDFT) and on each episode, I would invite on a new guest to talk about their life story. Unfortunately, I no longer make this show but I _know_ more podcasts are in my future.

I am interested in Digital Humanities because I have found myself so engaged in things related to it previously! Not only do I enjoy playing video games, but I enjoy their debated relationship with the Digital Humanities. _What makes a game DH? Are all games DH? **I want to know!**_

Within DH, I get a lot of inspiration from projects that make historic artifacts accessible and modern, such as [“Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights.”](https://archief.ntr.nl/tuinderlusten/en.html#) I find these projects to not only be educational, but accessible to people who would otherwise not know of them.

Connecting my fascinations of video games and accessibility, I am interested in making video games accessible and how that relates to DH. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of video games that have been forgotten by time that could easily be made accessible by developers. Recently, gamers have voiced their frustration for these "lost games."

Well, that just about covers me and my interests in Digital Humanities.
