and I am a junior at Christopher Newport University. I am a Communication Studies major and double-minor in Digital Humanities and Writing.

I am interested in Digital Humanities because I have found myself so engaged in it previously! Not only do I enjoy playing video games, but I enjoy their debated relationship with the Digital Humanities. What makes a game DH? Are all games DH? _I want to know!_
