### _About..._

_Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights_ (_GED_) is an “interactive documentary” project that guides audiences through a virtual tour of the above-named painting.

_GED_ greets users with a description of the project first, then, once read, continues to the main screen of the project - the painting itself. At this point, users may either explore the painting freely or select a virtual tour of the project. Both options visit the various important icons throughout the painting, signified by a flag icon.

Each interactive area has audio narrations, audio transcriptions, close-up visualizations, unique sound effects, and sometimes more background information.

The _GED_ team wanted audiences to be able to better understand life in the Late Middle Ages. To do so, they enriched Dutch artist Jheronimus Bosch’s painting with auditory, visual, and interactive elements.

The story of the painting itself focuses on the importance of religion in the Late Middle Ages. The depictions within the sprawling and detailed painting cover topics such as sin, morality, heaven, hell, and earth.

### _GED as DH..._

First, it is important to consider what makes _GED_ a Digital Humanities project. The project is based on and uses the original painting of the same name. The physical painting is a historic artifact, making it inaccessible to a majority of audiences for various reasons. 

_GED_ recreates the artifact using a digital format, interactive elements, and supplemental technologies (audio, visuals). The project allows for high-definition close-ups of the painting, which is a perspective someone would usually only be able to get in real life.

The _GED_ team wanted their project to read like a book, meaning audiences would be able to pick up and leave off wherever they wanted. The project was created with intentions for audiences to return multiple times, to explore the painting more and more.

_GED_ is not just a book, though. The project is not linear and has depth. The team selected the music, narrations, sounds, and visualizations in a manner that enriched the storytelling Bosch originally intended.

### _Review..._

The best part about _GED_ is the centralized interface. The project is present in one place, which makes it easy for audiences to know how to use it and what it is about. This element makes _GED_ not just an interactive project, but an immersive experience.

Before entering, _GED_ greets audiences with a description and instructions for using the project. While many DH projects have those two items in the project, it usually hides on a different page. The placement in _GED_ ensures the user experience is not interrupted.

_GED_ sets an example of a DH project exceeding in accessibility. By its very nature, _GED_ accommodates to those with auditory and visual impairments because the audio narration and transcriptions are always available.

The project offers resources on operating the project on different browsers and is available on mobile devices too! The only item limiting accessibility is a pop-up “cookies” window which appears in a different language, but users may easily bypass.

The main drawback I experienced in _GED_ was the missed opportunities in educating audiences about the project. 

The largest missed opportunity is the absence of any information on the “outer panels” of _GED_ (see “Panels” in top left). The inner panels are rich with information, music, narration, and more. The outer panels, however, have nothing except the original picture of the painting. This was unsatisfying, especially seeing how mysterious the outer panels are.

_GED_ left me wanting more. While the information present is rich and in-depth, I would still like to know more about the history of the painting itself, the artist, and the outer panels. It is reasonable to argue these things be included, seeing how relevant they are to the project.

_GED_ offers a great framework for what a DH project should be. It is educational, innovative, interactive, and significant. By far, there are more good things than bad things with this project. _GED_ should serve as an excellent example of accessibility and enrichment of source material for DH projects to come.
