## Course Reflection

“Writing for the Digital Humanities” taught an introductory approach to the field of Digital Humanities (DH), while at the same time, focused on a creator and writer perspective. This perspective is one I feel I did not take into account yet, mainly being a consumer of DH until I took the class.

### My Definition of DH…
I previously took “Introduction to Digital Humanities,” which worked to define the field. After taking both classes though, I would define DH as an innovative, interactive, and informative humanities project created through digital means or existing in a digital space. Usually, these DH projects have some sort of cultural relevance.
I would say that my personal definition of DH did not change over the course of this class. I would say, however, that I gained a newfound appreciation for DH projects and saw immense improvement in my writing skills.

### Reading and Writing…
The moment in the course where I started to experience the most improvement with writing is when we used the Hemingway Editor. The Heminway Editor is a website/app that color-coordinates your writing to indicate tension in writing. This includes passive voice, hard-to-read sentences, or too many adverbs. Throughout the rest of the class, I found Hemingway Editor to be really useful for all my writing.

In terms of the readings for this class, I experienced a harder time trying to make use of them. I think that when the course is so focused on creating, it’s hard to put long articles to practice. Tools like Hemingway Editor were more useful for me because I could actually use them when creating projects.
I started gaining more from the readings when we started working on our grant projects. Before this class, I really knew nothing about grant writing so activities and readings that taught about the grant writing and proposal process helped immensely. Specifically, having David Salomon come in and speak to the class about research grants at Christopher Newport University gave me direction and focus.

### The Assignments…
The various assignments we did were my favorite parts of this class. One of the first major projects we did, the review blog, was when the class started to make sense for me. The class finally started to take a writer/creator perspective which I was very excited for.
The next project, the TEI coding, is where I faced the most trouble. The assignment itself was very easy for me. In fact, the coding and blog writing probably took me under an hour with little editing. The real issue was the fact that I did not know what the purpose of the assignment was or how it related to “Writing in the Digital Humanities.” I enjoyed reading and learning about “Dracula’s Guest;” however, I would have liked more background on the purpose of the assignment.
For me, the grant assignment was extremely challenging yet rewarding. I was glad we were able to pick a topic that we were passionate about and had complete creative control in as well. It was a great exercise for the imagination and gave me skills I really feel like I could use in future jobs dealing with writing. The real challenge with this assignment came from personal struggles I experienced while taking this class.

### My Experience…
At the start, I struggled with how this class would be different from “Introduction to Digital Humanities.” The content from the first few weeks of class was a lot of the same things reviewed in IDST 270, which was discouraging for someone who had already taken it. I feel like IDST 270 should be a prerequisite for ENGL 350 so students are able to jump right into what it means to be a writer in the DH field. As stated earlier, the first assignment (the review blog) cleared these concerns.
Later in the class, I became passionate about various DH projects and even found myself changing my mind about strong opinions I previously held. Throughout my time in both IDST 270 and ENGL 350, I did not like Derrida’s Margins. Derrida’s Margins is a DH project that we continued to discuss in the two classes for its unique layout, design, and expansive content. Originally, I found the layout to be confusing and user-unfriendly. However, by the end of this course I found myself taking inspiration from it for my proposed project in the grant assignment. I finally appreciated the website for its unique design and educational content.

In April, my experience in the class was completely changed when I encountered a medical emergency. I woke up one morning to appendicitis which would go undiagnosed by doctors for two days and then rupture. The experience I had with this is unrelated to the course; however, I was bedridden in the hospital for three weeks causing me to miss the last month of classes and finals. After this happened, it was really difficult to get assignments done because I had such a hard time remembering and focusing on classes I took prior to such a traumatic experience. Diving back into the grant assignment was easier than I thought it to be, though, because I was and am so passionate about the topic.
